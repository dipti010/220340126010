1. Write a fact.py file for factorial
2. Write a Dockerfile
3. Run the command "sudo docker build -t python:code ." in the same location where your 
    Dockerfile is present.
4. Run the command "sudo docker images" to get the image Id
5. To run the conatiner use the command "sudo docker run -it ImageID"
    This will give a interactive mode of alpine. Now enter the desired number and get the output 
6. To push the docker image into docker hub we need to create a link tag for the image
7. Run the command "sudo docker tag python:code "
8. The above command will cerate a new image with the respective tag 
9. Now run the command "sudo docker push "
10. If you get a resource access denied error that means some other account is logined to the current system
    So, run "sudo docker logout" then
    "sudo docker login" and proide your credentials 
11. Again run the command shown in step 9, 
12. Now you can see the docker image in the docker hub
